# Alke-Club-Contact-page
My friend didn't take my page so I guess we can have it here then! ðŸ˜‰

# Project Overview
A full-stack Django web application for handling user feedback and contact form submissions. This project integrates front-end form handling with Django back-end functionality, enabling users to submit their information, which is then processed and acknowledged with a confirmation message. This web application also includes basic form validation and utilizes Djangoâ€™s CSRF protection for secure submissions

# Future Ideas
* An AI assitant that would be asked about the club, their core values and club opportunities
* A collection of internship opportunities for club members - not jobs but news posts, job links and seminars
* A slide show of new members. Probably fake members but there is definately going to be a slide show. That's web development 101
